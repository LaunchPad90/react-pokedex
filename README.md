# This project connects to a pokemon API which then displays all pokemon data.
![All Pokemon](./public/allPokemon.png)

## I also implemented a fuzzy search to narrow results
![Search Results](./public/searchResults.png)

## as well as filters by type and weakness which work in conjuction with each other. If you wanna find a pokemon with the type water, who also has a weakness to flying...
![Poliwrath](./public/poliwrath.png)

## or all pokemon of the type flying...
![Flying Pokemon](./public/flyingPokemon.png)

## and a details page that shows all available information as well as the next and previous evolutions (if any)...
![Wartortle Details](./public/wartortleDetails.png)

### This project was a learning experience with Reacts context api as well. I had not used it before and found it to be incredible. Making it so easy to pass data around and is something I am continuing to work with in other projects.
